		<b>Guild Charter</b>
		&nbsp;
		<p class="content">
			We are a core group of people who want to participate in WildStar's 40 man raids in the Elder game. We are not attempting to be world firsts. We don't want this to become a second job.
			However, we do want a group of 40+ people that are willing to work together to get better and see the end game content.
		</p>

		&nbsp;
		<b>Group Leader </b>
		&nbsp;
		<p>
			The group leader will be responsible for his/her specific group members. In previous guilds, he/she would be the equivalent of an officer. This leader will be completely responsible 
			for each of his/her group member's actions. This includes being responsible for getting his/her team to show up on time, as well as be prepared. The group leader will be able to 
			recruit as he/she sees fit as if the group was his own squad. This will create a sense of camraderie that is often found missing in larger guilds. The group leader will work together
			with the Guild Leader to make sure that there are no fights between groups as well as make sure that the guild is being run fairly and efficiently. We have 6 group leaders currently
			and are looking to recruit 2 more before launch. If you think you're interested, head over to the <a href="/public_html/phpbb/application.php">application page!</a>
			This is not a job for the flaky. We are looking for people who are willing to work as hard as us to make sure that everyone has a good time.
		</p>

		&nbsp;
		<b>Group Member</b>
		&nbsp;
		<p>
			The group member's responsibility is to follow his/her group leader's orders. Each group leader will have specific requirements for his members which will be fleshed out when that group
			leader does an "interview" run with you. Overall, a group member should be enjoyable to hang out with, able to raid at the times required, and be willing to have fun with a bunch of us.
			Currently these are the group leaders recruiting right now. The number in parentheses is the number of slots left
			<ul>
				<li>JarNod 			(4)</li>
				<li>Beta_Grumm 		(4)</li>
				<li>Chief Sarcan 	(4)</li>
				<li>Scelestic 		(4)</li>
				<li>Pedro 			(4)</li>
				<li>Gray 			(4)</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<b>Guild Member</b>

		<p>
			We aren't just interested in raiders though. If you want to join the guild because you have friends in the guild but you don't want to raid, please apply <a href="/public_html/phpbb/application.php">here</a> We would love to have you
			in the guild just to hang out with.
		</p>
